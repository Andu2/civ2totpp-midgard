# Civ 2 Test of Time: Midgard Events using Test of Time Patch Project (ToTPP)

## Description

### Original

A mostly faithful reconstruction of the original Test of Time Midgard scenario, with [bugs fixed](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/tot-midgard-woes.382827/).
Some more descriptive text has been added to help guide the player, and you can now press TAB to view the current quest status. The original Events.txt has been provided in this repository as reference.

### Enhanced

Coming later!

## Installation

First, make sure you have [ToTPP](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/the-test-of-time-patch-project.517282/) installed. These events were tested using ToTPP version 0.17.

### Original

Paste `events_original.lua` into your Midgard folder and rename it to `events.lua`.

If you have issues with techs being available that should not be researchable, such as "Ragnarok", 
try pasting the Midgard rules.txt into the Fantasy folder (make sure to back up the Fantasy rules.txt)
and start a Fantasy game before starting a Midgard game. I'm not sure why this happens, but it seems like
Midgard CIVILIZE2 / LEADERS2 rules don't load correctly when using ToTPP.
